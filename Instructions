Lets start:
Option1: PBC
1.Downlod the gerber, pickand place and BOM(Bill Of Materials) from this github repository.
2.Pruchase from JLCPCB or other vendor -note: PURCHASE ASSEMBLED!
3.WAIT... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... then,
4.Place Attiny85 in Attiny85 socket -note: small dip in the attiny85 should match rotation of dip in the socket.
5.Plug into arduino:
Works with Mega2560, Basic Nano And UnoR3.
for male heasders a female header pin set(1x8) is required. -note: if you have the skills, you can change the easyeda design(in this repository) to fit a male header with a female.
6.Download your Arduino's Script from this repository(Mega or Uno Or nano):
Uno_and_Mega_ISP_ATtiny85 OR Nano_ISP_ATtiny85
7.Upload TO ARDUINO(Mega,Nano,Uno)
8.Add the following link to the additional boards manager, In Prefrences, in the ide:   http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json
9. Download the Boards: Arduino IDE> Tools> Board> Board Manager> Search> AttinyCore> Install
10.Change Board:Tools> Board> AttinyCore> ATtiny25/45/85(No bootloader)
11.Change settings: Tools> Chip>ATtiny85, Tools> Clock source(only set on bootload): your choice of: 1mhz, 4mhz 8mhz(all worked for me), Tools> Port: Your programmer arduino(Mega,Nano,Uno)
12.Burn Bootloader: Tools> Programmer: Arduino as ISP, Tools> BurnBootloader
13.Done: you can now Choose your board upon needed change as: ATtiny25/45/85(No bootloader), Clock source(only set on bootload): your previous choice, and Port: Your programmer arduino.
Then I would upload some sort of test: You can use Test.ino from this github repository, then use an LED between pin gnd(Bottom left) and pb0(bottom right) -note: Duh... Add power.
